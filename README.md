# Umap_consensus

# Getting start
This program is based on the open-source NanoCLUST code, which we modified to perform ONT reads clustering for versatile amplicon-based projects. We tested the modified code using 16S full-length and 18S-ITS amplicons.

#Installation
#git clone https://github.com/Nattapong4321/Umap_consensus.git

# Requirement
#medaka (test with medaka version 1.7.3)
#FastANI (test with FastANI version 1.33)
#canu (test with canu version 2.2)
